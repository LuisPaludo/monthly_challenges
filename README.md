Project from the course Python Django - The Practical Guide (Udemy) by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller. The project is simple, and the objective 
is to catch some key elements from the Django framework. 

The project emphasizes creating new and dynamic URLs, using coding to generate responses and the basic structure of a Django project.
